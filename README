To create a token key you'll need to sign up for a Central account at Clickatell:
http://www.clickatell.com/register/account_signup.php

Once you've created your account, login and go to the "Manage my Product" page
and add a new "Clickatell Connect API Applications" entry. Once you've completed
the form you will be given a "API Application Session Token".


Create a config.php file in the test folder with the following details:

$sToken = [Token Key];


Then you should be able to tweak and run the various tests.


Tests should be run from the command line like this (to handle the captcha image
requirements for certain calls):

path/to/test$ php -f get_list_account.php
