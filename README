To create a token key you'll need to sign up for a Central account at Clickatell:
http://www.clickatell.com/register/account_signup.php

Once you've created your account, login and go to the "Manage my Product" page
and add a new "Clickatell Connect API Applications" entry. Once you've completed
the form you will be given a "API Application Session Token".


Create a config.php file in the test folder with the following details:

$sToken = [Token Key];


Then you should be able to tweak and run the various tests.
